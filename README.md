# ChimpTest App - iOS Game
Welcome to the Chimp Test Game! This iOS app, written in SwiftUI, challenges your memory and focus. The objective of the game is simple: follow the sequence of numbers, guess the next number in the sequence, and progress to the next level. But watch out! You only have 3 lives, and a wrong guess means you lose one.

## Features

### Game Play:
- The game begins with numbers 1 to 5 displayed in sequence. Your task is to click the number in order (1, then 2, then 3, and so on).
- With each successful level, a new number is added to the sequence, making the game progressively more difficult.
- You have 3 lives. Incorrect guesses will cause you to lose a life. When all lives are lost, itâ€™s game over!

### Customization:
- Choose between Dark Mode and Light Mode to suit your preference.
- Reset the game at any level to restart the challenge.

### Code Structure:
- The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, ensuring a clean separation of concerns between the UI, the data, and the game logic.

### Custom Data Structures:
- The app uses a Matrix data structure for various game mechanics.
- Linked List is used to manage data dynamically and efficiently.

- iOS 16 or later
